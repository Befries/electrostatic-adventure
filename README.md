Electrostatic Adventure is a university game project.
The game has to be made in kotlin with the usage of the OOP basics.

The goal is simple;
   - there's a maze you've got to go through with an electric charge called the journeyer.
   - to move the charge you have to put different charges wich shall generate an electric field
     and thus accelerate the journeyer.
   - there are plaques that can change the polarity of the charge to add spice to the game.
